# AOC 2023 Roundup

| Day | Title | General area | Difficulty | Comments |
|-----|------|---------------|------------|----------|
| 1  | Trebuchet?! | Parsing | 2  | More difficult than a general day 1 problem |
| 2  | Cube Conundrum | Maximum | 1 | Most of the challenge was parsing the input, algo logic not too bad |
| 3  | Gear Ratios | Grid Search | 2 | Part 2 was a little more challenging |
| 4  | Scratchcards | Cellular Autonoma | 1 | This was straightforward, brute force mostly worked |
| 5  | If You Give A Seed A Fertilizer | Linear Map / Case statements | 2 | Mostly tedious in carefully matching up case statements | 
| 6  | Wait For It | Quadratic Eq | 0 | Did not need code, just the quadratic formula |
| 7  | Camel Cards | Game / Automota | 2 | Really fun puzzle here |
| 8  | Haunted Wasteland | DFS / Cycles | 2 (4 in general case) | We were able to take some shortcuts because of non general properties of input |
| 9  | Mirage Maintenance | Difference Equations | 2 | Very satisfying, particularly easy to implement in Haskell, felt "clever" | 
| 10 | Pipe Maze | Path-finding / Pick theorem | 3 | Got to learn Pick's theorem and the shoelace formula |
| 11 | Cosmic Expansion | Cellular Autonoma | 1 | |
| 12 | Hot Springs | Dynamic programming | 2 | I liked this one (stretch in Haskell for me, straightforward in Python) |
| 13 | Point of Incidence | | 1 | Easy day today! |
| 14 | Parabolic Reflector Dish | Cellular Autonoma / Cycles | 2 | |
| 15 | Lens Library | | 2 | I kept making simple errros that were difficult to find (mostly in parsing). Also took a while to understand the problem -- convoluted but not hard |
| 16 | The Floor Will Be Lava | Area / Shoelace formula | 2 ||
| 17 | Crucible | BFS | 2 | Had an annoying bug that took a long time to find, but algo is at least conceptual straightforward | 
| 18 | Lavaduct Lagoon | Area / Shoelace (again!) | 1 | |
| 19 | Aplenty | State Machine / Cycles | 3 | | 
| 20 | Pulse Propagation | State Machine / Cycles | 4 | First one I felt really frustrated by. Required examination of the input for special properties |
| 21 | Step Counter | BFS | 2 | Longest path, with part 2 only requiring edge contraction to limit number of steps in BFS. |
| 22 | Sand Slabs | Geometry | 3 | Took a long time to find a silly problem. Hardest part was debugging this particular problem, as we needed to evolve a state first before solving |
| 23 | A Long Walk | | 2  | Longest path, with part 2 only requiring edge contraction to limit number of steps in BFS. |
| 24 | Never Tell Me The Odds | Systems of Equations | 1 (Part 1), 4 (Part 2) )| Part 2 was solving a system of quadratic equations, tedious by hand but possible. Learned a new optimize package to solve |
| 25 | Snowverload | Graph theory / Components | 3 | Was not a hard problem, but I don't know a lot of graph theory. Learned a lot studying this problem |
